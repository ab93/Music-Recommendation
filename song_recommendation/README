Song Recommendation

Aim

To recommend similar songs given a particular song

Working

It invloves two parts

1) Cluster formation -> make_cluster.R
2) find function to find similar songs -> find.R



1) Cluster formation

We use Kmeans clustering algorithm to group similar songs. The clustering algorithms use the metadata to group similar songs.
Appropriate no of clusters are decided to get minimum distance between songs.
We get cluster Id for each song. Same songs have same cluster Id.

2) find function

It takes a song as an input and gives similar songs based on same cluster ID
